# **THE INFLUENCE OF NET MIGRATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND INFLATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH
# **OVERVIEW
This project investigates the dynamic interplay between net migration, unemployment rates, and inflation, focusing on their collective impact on economic growth in the United States. Using time-series data spanning from 1961 to 2023, the study examines how these variables influence real GDP trends, providing valuable insights into economic drivers and the implications of policy decisions.

# **DATA USED 
The study leverages time-series data over 63 years (1961â€“2023) from reputable sources, including the Federal Reserve and the World Bank, to evaluate economic growth and its key determinants. Key datasets include:
1. Net Migration: Derived as the difference between immigration inflows and emigration outflows.
2. Unemployment Rate: Percentage of the labor force actively seeking employment but currently jobless.
3. Inflation: Annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
4. Real GDP: Percentage change in the total value of goods and services produced annually.
